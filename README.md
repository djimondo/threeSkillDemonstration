# threeSkillDemonstration
This is a brief demonstration of some of my skill with three.js

This scene contains two actors, actor1 and actor2.
actor1 is the bird, Ed
actor2 is the face

When actor2 is facing actor1, he will turn green. Change his y rotation with the slider to test this.

When the "Find Closest Bone" button is pressed, an alert will pop up with the closest bone in actor2 to actor1's root bone.
You can alter his y position with the slider to test this.

After 9 seconds there will be an alert of the actors mesh vertex, at an exact time.

For fun, use the slider to make actor 1 talk, by changing the influence of his shape key.

## Build
For dev, just run the command **vite**

To build, **vite build**
